# GFA-Predictor
Overview
The Glass GFA Predictor is a machine learning model developed to estimate the Glass Facade Area (GFA) of buildings based on various properties of glass utilized in their construction. This tool aims to assist architects, engineers, and urban planners in optimizing building design for enhanced aesthetics, energy efficiency, and sustainability.

Key Features
Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful insights from raw data through transformation and selection of relevant features.
Multi-layered Neural Network Architecture: Captures intricate patterns and relationships within the data using advanced neural network architectures.
Regression Analysis: Quantitatively predicts GFA values based on input features, minimizing prediction errors through iterative refinement.
Cross-Validation: Ensures robustness and generalization by partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets to prevent overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model performance through rigorous tuning of parameters such as learning rate, regularization strength, and network architecture.
Interpretability: Provides insights into the relative importance of different glass properties in determining GFA for actionable design optimization.
